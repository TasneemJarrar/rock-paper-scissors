## 📌 About the Project
This project is an **object-oriented Rock Paper Scissors game** featuring multiple AI opponents with unique strategies!  
It's part of my **Intro to Programming Nanodegree** with Udacity, where I practiced:
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (classes, inheritance, methods)
- **Class inheritance** with parent/child classes
- **Polymorphism** - different player behaviors with the same interface
- **Game state management** and score tracking
- **User input validation**
- **Strategic AI development**

---

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Run the game: `python rps.py`
2. Choose your opponent from 5 different player types
3. Select how many rounds you want to play
4. Make your moves and try to win!

---

## 🤖 AI Opponents
- **AllRockPlayer** - Always plays rock (predictable but solid)
- **RandomPlayer** - Completely random moves (chaos mode!)
- **ReflectPlayer** - Mirrors your previous move (adaptive strategy)
- **CyclePlayer** - Cycles through moves in order (pattern-based)
- **HumanPlayer** - Play against another human!

---

## ✨ Features
- 🎯 **Multiple AI strategies** - Each opponent has unique behavior
- 📊 **Score tracking** - Live score updates after each round
- 🔄 **Flexible rounds** - Choose how many rounds to play
- 🎨 **Clean OOP design** - Parent class with specialized child classes
- ✅ **Input validation** - Ensures valid moves and choices
- 🧠 **Learning AI** - Some players adapt based on previous moves

---

## 🛠 Built With
- **Python 3** - Core programming language
- **random module** - For AI decision-making
- **OOP principles** - Classes, inheritance, and polymorphism

---

## 📚 Acknowledgements
- **Udacity** — for the awesome Intro to Programming Nanodegree.
- The classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game we all know and love.
- **AI strategy design** inspired by game theory concepts.

## 💡 My Notes
This project really helped me understand OOP more than I already do! 🧠 Creating different player classes that all inherit from the same parent was a game-changer (pun intended). 

The ReflectPlayer is sneaky - it actually learns from your moves! And the CyclePlayer is great for testing if you can spot patterns. 

I might add a SmartPlayer that uses probability analysis next... because why not? 😎

P.S. If you always pick rock, the AllRockPlayer will destroy you. You've been warned! 🪨
